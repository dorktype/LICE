LICE is an experiment to see how close I can get to a C compiler looking
at the sources of existing ones like TCC, GCC and SubC, while still
keeping the code easy to understand and well documented for my own sake.

Support currently is as follows:
    Types:
        There are currently only two types supported, int and char, as
        well as the pointer and array versions of those types. There is
        no support for signed/unsigned keywords, all types are handled
        as signed integer types.

        There is no support for floating point operations, not because
        the type doesn't exist (which would potentially prevent such
        operations) but because stack space isn't aligned on 16 byte
        boundry yet to accomodate it, and the registers themselfs aren't
        properly saved/restored to allow it, so calling external float-aware
        functions will likely crash.

    Functions:
        Functions are supported but function prototyping isn't which means
        the function has to be implemented where it's declared. Functions
        are limited to six arguments, and variable arguments are not
        supported. Calling external C variable argument functions such
        as printf are allowed but the argument count is also limited to six.
        You can also call malloc/free for heap allocations.

    Statements:
        Lice currently supports three statements:
            if      - Your standard if statement
            for     - Your standard for statement
            return  - Your standard return statement

    Operators:
        Lice only supports the following operators:
            +,-,/,* - Arithmetic operators
            =       - Assignment operator
            ==      - Equality operator
            <       - Less than operator
            >       - Greater than operator
            !       - Boolean not operator
            (,)     - Only supported in pointer dereferencing, e.g *(a + b)
            []      - Array subscript operator

        Lice doesn't support the terse version of those operators, e.g
            +=, -=, ... aren't supported.

        There is no post/pre increment operators

    Constructs:
        There is no support for structures, switches or unions. There
        is however support for array initializer lists, e.g
            int a[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
            int a[2] = { 1, 2 };

        There is also support for multidimensional arrays:
            int a[1][2][3][4];

        Statement block constructs must exist for every statement, e.g
            if (a)
        Must have a block { } on it. Eliding the block will result
        in a compiler error. This will be fixed once compound statements
        are implemented.

    Pointers:
        Pointers work how they typically would work, you can define one,
        take the address of one and have as many layers of referencing
        and dereferencing as you want. Pointer arithmetic works as well.
        Pointers to functions aren't supported. You can also dereference
        pointers into assignments, e.g *a=b; works, as does *(a+N)=b;

    Comments:
        Currently the source can contain no C or C++ style comments.

    Globals:
        While support for global data generation exists in the code
        generator, globals aren't supported since scoping doesn't
        exist yet. Which means code like:
            int f() { { int a; } }

        Won't compile. Once compound statements are implemented those
        blocks of code will be interpeted as a compound statement.


    Code generation:
        The codegen is unoptimal crap, it produces a 'stack machine'
        model which isn't exactly efficent. All registers are saved
        and restored while they mostly may not need to be. Return
        statements need to emit leave instructions even though they
        might not need to be. Operations will always load operands
        into the first closest registers and store the result back
        into the first, even though that operation may already
        put the result into the first.

    Rescurive functions:
        Recursive functions work as you'd expect them to.

    Supported platforms:
        The code generator produces code compatible in accordance to
        the SysV ABI for AMD64. So it should function on any AMD64
        Linux or FreeBSD system.

### Epilogue
LICE is a work in progress C99 compiler designed as a solution for
teaching myself and others about the C programming language, how to
write a compiler for it, and code generation.

Part of the philosophy behind LICE is to provide a public domain
implementation of a working conformant C99 compiler. As well as borrowing
extensions and ideas from existing compilers to ensure a wider range of
support.

### Status
LICE as it stands is fairly complete, the base language support for C99
only lacks a few trivial things, albeit important ones. For instance, while
most type specifiers and complicated declarations are accepted, the semantics
and behavior of them aren't handled. So, to outline the inconsistencies,
a list has been provided below.

-   Direct function calls are fully supported, but limited; for instance,
    function calls cannot exceed six arguments. Some calls may fail since
    stack alignment isn't fully correct, which may break floating point
    operations.

-   Indirect function calls aren't supported, but declaring, and taking
    the address of functions are.

-   There is no support for copying structures, or passing structures by
    copy through functions.

-   String concatenation for adjacent strings isn't supported.

-   There is no preprocessor.

-   Taking the address of a structure for assigning to structure field of pointer
    type of that same structure isn't supported.

-   There is no comma operator.

-   Boolean operations aren't properly converted to 0 or 1.

-   Conformant implicit and explicit arithmetic conversion isn't supported,
    at least not inline with what the standard defines as promotion ranking.
    Similarly, implicit type conversion isn't correct either.

-   There is no support for logical right shift operations, so code like
    `((unsigned)-1) >> 31)` won't give correct results.

-   Conditional tests that use a `float, double`, or `long double` type
    condition aren't casted to boolean type, so they may give wrong
    results.

-   Omitting the semicolon at the end of a structure or union member list
    isn't supported.

-   Return values are not booleanized.

-   Unspecified fields of a literal structure aren't default initialized
    to zero.

-   Initializing global variable with a pointer to another global variable
    isn't supported.

-   Structures cannot be initialized with literal struct.

-   Bitfields aren't supported.

-   Floating point constants beginning with `.` aren't supported.

-   C99 `typeof` keyword isn't supported.

-   Character literals are interpreted as type `char`, opposed to type `int`,
    this is a direct violation of the C standard.

-   Typedef names don't share the same namespace as ordinary identifiers, this
    is a direct violation of the C standard.

-   Old K&R C style functions aren't supported.

-   Unicode character literals aren't supported.

### Prologue
If you don't find yourself needing any of the stuff which is marked as being
unsupported above then you may find that LICE will happily compile your
source into x86-64 assembly. The code generation is close from optimal.
LICE treats the entire system as a giant stack machine, since it's easier
to generate code that way. The problem is it's hardly efficent. All local
variables are assigned on the stack for operations. All operations operate
from the stack and write back the result to the stack location that is
the destination operand for that operation.

### Porting
LICE should be farily straightforward to retarget for a specific architecture
or ABI. Simply writing a backend code generator and duplicating `amd64.h`,
and making the nessecary changes should be sufficent enough. Implicit and
explicit type conversions may need to be changed to compensate for oddities
in the architecture, the good news is that is self contained as part of `ast.c`
in `ast_type_result`. Retargeting is otherwise a painless task.


### Future Endeavors
-   Full C90 support (almost complete)

-   Full C99 support

-   Full C11 support

-   Preprocessor

-   Intermediate stage with optimizations (libfirm?)

-   Code generation (directly to elf/coff, et. all)

-   Support for x86, ARM, PPC
